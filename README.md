# Purpose

Allows you to rename all and only the image files (and video files) in a folder at once.

The file extensions recognised as belonging to image or video files are found in `extensions.py`.

All the files are assigned numbers plus your chosen text. For example, if your chosen text was "Our Wedding", the files would be renamed:

- `01_our_wedding.jpg`
- `02_our_wedding.jpg`
- `03_our_wedding.jpg`
- ... etc

The script ignores sub-folders and any files within those sub-folders. The script also ignores any files that might have two "." in their file names or file extensions. 

# Caveat

Use this script at your own risk. Back-up important files. We take no responsibility for any lost or corrupted files!
