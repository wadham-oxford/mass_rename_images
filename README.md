# Purpose

Allows you to quickly rename all files in a folder. All the files are assigned numbers plus your chosen text. 

The intended use-case was for renaming all photos in a folder since default photo names are usually not very descriptive. 

# Excluded

The script ignores sub-folders and any files within those sub-folders. The script also ignores any files that might have two "." in their file names or file extensions.
