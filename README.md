# Purpose

Allows you to quickly rename all files in a folder. The intended use-case was for renaming all photos in a folder since default photo names are usually not very descriptive. 

All the files are assigned numbers plus your chosen text. For example, if your chosen text was "Our Wedding", the files would be renamed:

- 01_our_wedding.jpg
- 02_our_wedding.jpg
- 03_our_wedding.jpg
- ...

The script ignores sub-folders and any files within those sub-folders. The script also ignores any files that might have two "." in their file names or file extensions. 

# Caveat

Use this script at your own risk. Back-up important files. I take no responsibility for any lost or corrupted files!
